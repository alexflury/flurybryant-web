                  At <b><i>Flury Bryant Design Group, Inc.</i></b>, we are dedicated to listening to the needs of our clients, and delivering to them projects that consistently exceed their expectations. 
                  <br>
                  <br>Over the past twenty-six years, our group, doing business as <b><i>The Bob Flury Design Group</b></i>, has been commissioned to design and detail over nine hundred thirty projects, ranging in size from small remodels and additions, to large estate properties with multiple buildings. We work with a large group of consultants and builders, giving us the capability of handling all aspects of a project, from conception and budget-building through site development, architectural and structural detail development, interior design and detailing, and ultimately, completed construction.
                  <br>
                  <br>Our design work is always sensitive to the specific needs and wishes of our clients. We listen to their goals, making their accomplishment our top priority.
                  <br>
                  <br>Our staff has had extensive experience working with the Planning and Building Department staff of literally every municipality in the area. We know how to get projects approved. If we can’t answer your zoning and building questions off the tops of our heads, we know who to call at City Hall to get the answers.
                  <br>
                  <br>The following is a partial list of the jurisdictions we have worked in followed by the number of projects we have completed in each:
