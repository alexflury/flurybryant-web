<p>Over the past thirty-five years, <em>Flury Bryant Design Group</em>, originally doing business as <em>The Bob Flury Design Group</em>, has been commissioned to design and detail over one thousand two hundred fifty residential projects, ranging in size from small remodels and additions to large estate properties with multiple buildings. We work with a large group of consultants and builders, giving us the capability of handling all aspects of a project, from conception and budget-building, through site development, architectural and structural detail development, interior architecture and detailing, and ultimately, completed construction.</p>
<p>Our preferred approach to preparation of our construction documents is unusual, in that we prefer to prepare all of the structural drawings ourselves, creating a set of documents that integrates the structural detailing with the architectural in a seamless, user-friendly fashion.</p>
<p>Our design work is always sensitive to the specific needs and wishes of our clients. We listen to their goals, making the accomplishment of these goals our top priority.</p>
<p>Our staff has had extensive experience working with the Planning and Building Departments of literally every municipality in the area. We know what it takes to get projects approved. If we don't have the answers to your zoning and building questions, we know who to contact at City Hall to get the answers.</p>

<p>The following is a partial list of the jurisdictions in which we have worked, followed by the number of projects in each:</p>

<p>Whether your preference is timeless, traditional design, state-of-the-art contemporary architecture, or seamless blending of new construction to existing, our staff of dedicated professionals has the resources and the passion to create an environment designed around your tastes, personality, and dreams, with the specific purpose of enhancing your lifestyle.</p>

<a class="anchor" name="philosophy"></a>
<h1>OUR OPERATING PHILOSOPHY</h1>

<p><em>Flury Bryant Design Group</em> aspires to be the local industry leader, providing architectural services to the local custom residential market. Our goal is to provide our clients with the highest level of service-oriented project management, the finest personalized design in the industry, and undisputed value for every dollar spent.</p>
<p>To achieve these goals, our design solutions tend to continuously evolve from initial conceptualization, through completed construction documents and often through the construction process. There is rarely a point in the process where we "complete" the design and move on to detailing.</p>
<p>Through the years, this approach has resulted in a level of design and client satisfaction far above industry standards. Our clients, many of whom are extremely gifted designers and innovators in their own fields, tend to be very proactive throughout the design process. We encourage our clients to participate with us at this level in the hope that they will achieve the same level of affinity for their project that we strive for.</p>

<a class="anchor" name="mission"></a>
<h1>OUR MISSION STATEMENT</h1>

<p><em>Flury Bryant Design Group</em> is a residential design firm aimed at providing homeowners throughout Santa Clara, San Mateo, and Santa Cruz Counties, and beyond, with integrated, comprehensive, and creative architectural design services for both remodel projects and new homes. By partnering with consultants and builders that share our passion for excellence, our goal is to consistently deliver finished projects that far exceed client expectations, as well industry and local standards.</p>
<p>We strive to train our staff members in the artistic tradition of the design professions, as well as the latest state-of-the-art technology, with the ambition of providing our clients with sophisticated and innovative design solutions presented in artistic, easy to understand formats. We endeavor to form partnerships with our clients, our employees, consultants, and the communities we help to shape, resulting in beautiful homes that exude pride and add value.</p>
<p>Our goal is to become the regionally recognized industry leader, experiencing moderate growth and annual profitability, while bringing excitement, fun, and integrity to the home-building and remodeling experience.</p>

<a class="anchor" name="process"></a>
<h1>OUR PROCESS</h1>

<h2>Design Programming</h2>
<p>Before design work can begin in earnest, a written program for the project is developed. This program describes, in as much detail as possible, the client's architectural and functional objectives, as well as the overall project scope.</p>
<p>Some of our clients come to us having already developed a design program, while others merely have general objectives in mind. Our staff can work with clients to fully develop their written program in either case.</p>

<h2>Code/Zoning Research</h2>
<p>Before the design for any project can be developed, the rules governing the development must be thoroughly researched, on a site-specific basis, and understood. In recent years these regulations have become increasingly more complex, and can vary dramatically from one jurisdiction to the next.</p>

<h2>Documentation of Existing Conditions</h2>
<p>Whether remodeling or building a new home, the existing conditions at the project site must be carefully documented in order to approach the design process intelligently.</p>
<p>In the case of a new home, this documentation consists of a topography map and property line survey, showing the physical characteristics, recorded property lines and any easements. This work is contracted to a qualified surveyor or civil engineering consultant.</p>
<p>In the case of a remodel, "as-built" plans, based on carefully collected measurements, must be drafted before design work can begin. This work is done by the staff of <em>Flury Bryant Design Group</em>.</p>

<h2>Schematic Design</h2>
<p>Once the design program has been established and the regulations governing the development of the project are established, the design process begins. During the Schematic Design Phase, broad-brush planning and design directions are explored in a very preliminary fashion. Potential solutions are presented for further discussion and critique by the client.</p>

<h2>Design Development</h2>
<p>Once a schematic direction has been determined, the Design Development Phase is initiated. During this phase, the design is further developed through the generation of more formal drawings. Typically, these drawings will consist of site, floor, and roof plans, and exterior elevations indicating material selections and building masses.</p>
<p>Aside from providing a vehicle to further study and understand the design, these drawings are typically used by prospective builders to develop a preliminary construction budget for the project, and eventually become part of the drawing package necessary to obtain any required preliminary design approval from the governing municipality.</p>
<p>Depending largely on the scope of a project, the approval process in many jurisdictions may include a formal design review hearing, often consisting of a public forum where neighborhood input is solicited. The specific submittal requirements vary from one municipality to another, and may include participation by other members of the design team, such as a civil or geotechnical engineer, and a landscape architect.</p>

<h2>Construction Documents</h2>
<p>The construction documents for any project contain all of the details required for a building permit application and, ultimately, for construction. Depending on the scope of the project, a team of consultants is assembled and orchestrated by our staff to prepare supporting documents for those drawings prepared by <em>Flury Bryant Design Group</em>, such as soils reports, structural calculations, energy calculations, etc.</p>

<h2>Plan-Check Phase</h2>
<p>Once a completed building permit application has been submitted with all of the required documentation, the Planning and Building Departments of the municipality having jurisdiction will review the documents for building code and zoning ordinance compliance, as well as general content and coordination across the various disciplines. This review will often involve other departments and agencies such as the Fire Department, Public Works, the Engineering Department, the local school district, etc. This typically results in a list of comments that must be addressed by the design team before a building permit can be issued.</p>
<p>Once these comments have been satisfactorily addressed, the building permit is issued, and construction can begin.</p>

<h2>Construction Administration</h2>
<p>During the construction phase of the project, <em>Flury Bryant Design Group</em> staff is available to provide support services at whatever level is appropriate. Generally, larger projects will require more support than smaller ones. However, since each project has its own unique set of circumstances, this is evaluated on a project by project basis.</p>
