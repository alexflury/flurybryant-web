<h2 class="first">WHO WE ARE</h2>
<p>Over the past twenty-nine years, our group, originally doing business as <em>The Bob Flury Design Group</em>, has been commissioned to design and detail over nine-hundred fifty residential projects, ranging in size from small remodels and additions to large estate properties with multiple buildings. We work with a large group of consultants and builders, giving us the capability of handling all aspects of a project, from conception and budget-building, through site development, architectural and structural detail development, interior architecture and detailing, and ultimately, completed construction.</p>
<p>Our approach to preparation of our construction documents is unusual, in that we prepare all of the structural drawings ourselves, creating a set of documents that integrates the structural detailing with the architectural in a seamless, user-friendly fashion.</p>
<p>Our design work is always sensitive to the specific needs and wishes of our clients. We listen to their goals, making the accomplishment of these goals our top priority.</p>
<p>Our staff has had extensive experience working with the Planning and Building Departments of literally every municipality in the area. We know what it takes to get projects approved. If we don't have the answers to your zoning and building questions, we know who to contact at City Hall to get the answers.</p>
<p>The following is a partial list of the jurisdictions in which we have worked, followed by the number of projects in each:</p>

<h2>OUR OPERATING PHILOSOPHY</h2>
<p><em>Flury Bryant Design Group</em> aspires to be the local industry leader, providing architectural services to the local custom residential market. Our goal is to provide our clients with the highest level of service-oriented project management, the finest personalized design in the industry, and undisputed value for every dollar spent.</p>
<p>To achieve these goals, our design solutions tend to continuously evolve from initial conceptualization, through completed construction documents and often through the construction process. There is rarely a point in the process where we "complete" the design and move on to detailing.</p>
<p>Through the years, this approach has resulted in a level of design and client satisfaction far above industry standards. Our clients, many of whom are extremely gifted designers and innovators in their own fields, tend to be very proactive throughout the design process. We encourage our clients to participate with us at this level in the hope that they will achieve the same level of affinity for their project that we strive for.</p>

<h2>MISSION STATEMENT</h2>
<p><em>Flury Bryant Design Group</em> is a residential design firm aimed at providing homeowners throughout Santa Clara, San Mateo, and Santa Cruz Counties with integrated, comprehensive, and creative architectural design services for both remodel projects and new homes. By partnering with consultants and builders that share our passion for excellence, our goal is to consistently deliver finished projects that far exceed client expectations, as well industry and local standards.</p>
<p>We strive to train our staff members in the artistic tradition of the design professions, as well as the latest state-of-the-art technology, with the ambition of providing our clients with sophisticated and innovative design solutions presented in artistic, easy to understand formats. We endeavor to form partnerships with our clients, our employees, consultants, and the communities we help to shape, resulting in beautiful homes that exude pride and add value.</p>
<p>Our goal is to become the regionally recognized industry leaders, experiencing moderate growth and annual profitability, while bringing excitement, fun, and integrity to the home-building and remodeling experience.</p>
